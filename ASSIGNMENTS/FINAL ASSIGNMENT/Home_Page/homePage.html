          <p>It’s a great way to start getting back into one-night stands until eventually you won’t need it anymore because you’ve finally found that true love. I thought I found true love, and I did for about 3 years. Looks like it’s back to getting my back blown????</p>

          <h1>Nancy Landgraab ___________________</h1>
          <p>So never thought I would say this but I found the love of my life on OnlySmash lol. So so many bad experiences to go through to get to him. But honestly, he is worth all that sacrifice. Keep your head up folks, you will get there.</p>

          <h1>Nico Bellic ___________________</h1>
          <p>I met my wife through OnlySmash! I owe them that! Good service and I liked how easy it was to use. It's more of a dating app now than a hook up app that it started out as. The idea was ingenious and I'm happy I used it to find my life partner.</p>
