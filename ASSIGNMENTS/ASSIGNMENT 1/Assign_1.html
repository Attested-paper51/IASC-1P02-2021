           <li><p><font size = "3">Set a few years after the end of the original Dragon Ball story. <strong>Goku</strong> comes to visit his friends at Kame House and introduces his son, <strong>Gohan</strong>. The happiness of his reunion is short-lived however when an alien who calls himself <strong>Raditz</strong> arrives and reveals Goku's <em>true origins</em>. After Raditz kidnaps Gohan to use as a bargaining chip against him. Goku is forced to team up with his old adversay <strong>Piccolo</strong> to fight Raditz. They succeed but at a high cost and it turns out Raditz was just the precursor to a much bigger threat on the way.</font></p>

           <li><p><font size = "3">The battle against <strong>Nappa</strong> and <strong>Vegeta</strong> is won but at the cost of <strong>Yamcha, Tien Shinhan, Chiaotzu, and Piccolo's</strong> lives. Since Piccolo was linked to Kami and he was the creator of the Earth's Dragon Balls, their deaths mean the Dragon Balls are now useless.
             All seems lost until Popo reveals that Kami had came from a planet called Namek and they could have Dragon Balls of their own to use. Bulma fixes up a ship and Gohan, Krillin and she head off to the planet while Goku waits to heal so he can follow after them later.
             However when the trio arrive on the planet, they find it's under siege by a tyrannical overlord named <strong>Frieza</strong> who likewise is after the Dragon Balls. Complicating matters is that Vegeta, having recovered from his defeat on Earth, is also after the <strong><em>Dragon Balls</em></strong>.</font></p>
